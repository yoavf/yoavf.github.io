A few months ago I started a vegetable garden in our back yard. It took quite a bit of work, but it was a lot of fun and it&#8217;s incredibly satisfying to see the fruits (and vegetables) of your labor grow.

I originally planted some lettuces, broccoli, cress, carrots, rocket, and parsley, and later added some zucchini and green peas. Most of these have grown pretty nicely:



I&#8217;ve now started working on some new garden beds, where I&#8217;ll plant summer veggies like tomatoes and peppers.
