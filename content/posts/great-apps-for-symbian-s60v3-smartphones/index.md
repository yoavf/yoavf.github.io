Keeping track of all the apps I've got installed on my phone is not an easy task. Here's a quick list of the most important ones:

  * [amAze GPS][1] - Worldwide GPS Turn By TurnÂ  navigation
  * [Fring][2] - IM and VOIP with skype/gtalk etc.
  * [Gmail][3] - Useful when I need to make a search for an old email message.
  * [Gravity][4] &#8211; The best symbian twitter client.
  * [Mecanto][5] &#8211; Streams all your music collection.
  * [Mobbler][6] - Couldn't live without it. Scrobble and streams music to and from last.fm. [Good review @ symbian-guru][7].
  * [Nokia Location Tagger][8] - Tags the camera phone pictures with location data.
  * [Nokia Messaging][9] - Push mail from my Gmail account.
  * [Nokia Sports Tracker][10] - Great combination of mobile app and web service. Uses the GPS to track speed, distance and course while running/walking etc.
  * [Opera Mini][11] - While the phone native web browser is quite good, Opera Mini is useful for a quick Wikipedia search from time to time
  * [Qik][12] - A great video stream that's really [easy to install][13] and run.
  * [Skyfire][14] - Another web browser, but the only that can display flash/silverlight/whatever on a symbian phone. Hopefully will get faster and more stable with future releases.
  * [Telmap Nav][15] - Another TBT navigation app. I'm currently beta testing the new version. Really cool stuff.
  * [WirelessIRC][16] - A prefect IRC client.
  * [Wordmobi][17] - Awesome WordPress blog editor.
