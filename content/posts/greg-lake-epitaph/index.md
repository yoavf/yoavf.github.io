King Crimson&#8217;s [In the Court of the Crimson King][1] is the album that made me fall in love with Prog Rock. [Greg Lake][2]&#8216;s powerful vocals on the track _Epitaph_ have much to do with this.

Written around 1969, the **lyrics** (by Pete Sinfield) are _[almost prophetic][3]:_

> The wall on which the prophets wrote  
> Is cracking at the seams  
> Upon the instruments of death  
> The sunlight brightly gleams  
> When every man is torn apart  
> With nightmares and with dreams,  
> Will no one lay the laurel wreath  
> As silence drowns the screams
> 
> [&#8230;]
> 
> Knowledge is a deadly friend  
> If no one sets the rules  
> The fate of all mankind I see  
> Is in the hands of fools

Greg Lake [passed away][4] this week, at 69.
