I had some fun a couple of nights ago creating a [silly website][1] that tracks how often Claude Code tells me "You're absolutely right!" during coding sessions.

<img decoding="async" src="images/absolutely-right.png" alt="Screenshot of the website absolutelyright.lol showing a hand drawn bar chart" width="550" height="600" />


I [open-sourced][2] it (of course) and posted it to Hacker News, thinking some people might enjoy the joke. 

Turns out I was absolutely right! ðŸ¤£

It hit number 2 on the HN front page and got over 100k page views in less than a day. I really enjoyed seeing how people noticed some of the small details I obsessed over.

Also: Rust + mostly vanilla JS FTW! The site never crossed 15% CPU utilization on the smallest [Fly.io][3] machine.
