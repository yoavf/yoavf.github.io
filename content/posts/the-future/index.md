So we bought this fairly difficult to assemble product the other day, and on the package was a big QR Code. I scanned the code with my phone, and Android detected a link to a YouTube video and offered a few choices for playing it. One of those was &#8220;Play on XBMC&#8221;, thanks to the XBMC remote app (XBMC is the software that runs on our living room HTPC).
