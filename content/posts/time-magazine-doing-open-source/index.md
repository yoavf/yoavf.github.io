A couple of days ago, Time Magazine published &#8220;[How Popular Will Your Name Be in 25 Years?][1]&#8221; &#8211; it&#8217;s a fun and interesting analysis of the US Social Security Administration&#8217;s baby name data. The part I loved most?

> The source code for this project is [available][2] on Time&#8217;s GitHub page.

Amazing.
