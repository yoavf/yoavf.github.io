Today was Jonathan&#8217;s first day of Kindergarten. On the way home, as the radio played Eli Mohar and Yoni Rechter&#8217;s &#8220;As Long&#8221;, I burst into tears.

While it doesn&#8217;t do the original any justice, here&#8217;s my attempt to translate [the lyrics][1] to English:

> A boy walking down the street  
> On a clear September morning  
> To the school the children go out again  
> A man walks behind him  
> Watches, sees &#8211; unseen  
> And only later he stands there, witnessing
> 
> How another year starts there  
> Like every year, in the fall,  
> How a son walks alone  
> With a father in his steps
> 
> A man sees, hiding  
> How his son enters the classroom  
> A man stands like a child left outside  
> And inside they sing already  
> An hymn for the new year  
> Oh how it all starts over again
> 
> Once more they sing of the rain  
> Once more they sing of the fall  
> And once more the letters are written on the board
> 
> (a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h.i.j.k.l.m.n.o.p.q.r.s.t.u.v.w.x.y.z)
> 
> A man midmorning  
> A man mid life  
> At the school gate he stands alone  
> He remembers his own dad  
> Once walked behind him  
> He tries to hear his steps
> 
> But the children still sing  
> A song of the first rain and autumn flowers  
> And the man lips are whispering too:  
> As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death  
> I will fear not  
> Even if I suddenly fall  
> My heart will sing
> 
> As long as the morning comes  
> As long as the letters are written  
> As long as a son walks  
> With his father in his steps  
> As long as the children sing  
> Of the new year  
> As long as it all starts over again
> 
> As long as the sea awakes  
> As long as the wind rises  
> As long as on the blackboard  
> A word will be drawn
