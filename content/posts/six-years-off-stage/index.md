I realized today it&#8217;s been six years since my last conference talk at [WordCamp Kathmandu 2019][1]. I used to make a point of speaking at least once a year â€“ it took a lot of work to prepare, but the energy in the room and the conversations afterward always made it worthwhile. Covid interrupted that streak and I somehow never picked it back up. I really do miss it.
