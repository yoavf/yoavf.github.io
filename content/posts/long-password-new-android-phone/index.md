I use a password managerÂ and create veryÂ long passwords whereÂ possible, including for my Google account. The problem? when setting up a new Android phone, I can&#8217;t download the password manager app until I&#8217;ve logged into my Google account, which is nearly impossible without the password manager app.

The workaround? Enable USB debugging on the phone, and use [ADB][1]Â to enter the password:

```bash
./adb shell input text "LONG COMPLICATED PASSWORD"
```

Is it safe enough? Probably not. Use at your own risk ðŸ™‚
