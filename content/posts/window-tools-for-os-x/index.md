It took me some time to find these great apps, so I figured a mention might help others:

  * [Shift It][1] enables easy moving and resizing of windows using the keyboard (expandsÂ  the concept of Aero Snap)  
    [<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-465" title="shift" src="images/shift1.jpg" alt="Shiftit app for mac screenshot" width="164" height="237" />][2]
  * [Afloat][3] will let you keep windows on top, adjust window transparency and much more.  
    [<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-466" title="afloat" src="images/afloat1.jpg?w=300&h=124" alt="Afloat app for mac screenshot" width="300" height="124"   />][4]

In case you&#8217;re wondering, they&#8217;re both free _and_ open source.
