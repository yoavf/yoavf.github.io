> I knew of course, that there were people protesting that we shouldn&#8217;t export our natural gas (I don&#8217;t want to hurt their democratic enthusiasm, but they should know that there isn&#8217;t any megaphone that can be heard in a cabinet meeting) 

This is a translated excerpt from a Facebook [status post][1] by Israel&#8217;s Secretary of Finance, Yair Lapid. 

What is he saying exactly? That it&#8217;s not worth protesting when a politician fails to be true to his promises? That we, as citizens, shouldn&#8217;t bother voice our discontent when the government sells the country&#8217;s limited natural resources for cheap, without proper discussion in parliament?

Douchebag.
