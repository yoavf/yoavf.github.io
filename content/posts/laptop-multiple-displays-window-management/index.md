This is a followup to a previous post about [window management tools for OS X][1].

[<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="images/stay1.png?w=150&h=150" alt="" title="Stay" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-525"   />][2]I&#8217;ve recently started using a 2nd external monitor connected to my laptop (using [Plugable&#8217;s DisplayLink Adapter][3]). Since I was switching from laptop only to laptop + 2 external displays at least once a day, I needed to figure out a way to save/restore applications and windows positions.  
I was really happy to discover [Stay][2], a pretty good app that does just that (30 day trial, $15 for the full version).
