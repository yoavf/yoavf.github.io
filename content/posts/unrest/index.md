And so many questions.

It&#8217;s been a week since the &#8220;Flotilla&#8221; events.  
I can&#8217;t remember when news, any news, perturbed me so much.  
Not because of what happened, but because of why, and how.

How did it get to be this way?

Why do I believe one side or the other?  
Is there _a_ truth?

With so much hate and violence, can it ever end?  
And how can you not lose hope?

I don&#8217;t know.  
&#8212;

When I talk about this conflict, I often say _I feel_ or _I believe_.  
But I don&#8217;t like to talk about it because I don&#8217;t _know._

I started reading about history this week, frantically. Maybe this will help.

If anybody has answers, please, share.
