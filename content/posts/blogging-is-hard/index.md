Really. I had a blog in Hebrew &#8211; and it got stale to the point I just closed it.  
This blog doesn&#8217;t get updated very often either.

And yet &#8211; I&#8217;m trying again. This time, it&#8217;s all about [WordPress, in Hebrew][1]. And not only that, I&#8217;ve committed to [a post a day][2].
