I&#8217;m really excited to be giving a talk at [WordCamp Jerusalem][1] in a couple of weeks &#8211; the third Israeli WordCamp and the first in Jerusalem.

My talk will be an in-depth overview of WordPress i18n and RTL &#8211; a topic I already addressed in a quick 7 minutes presentation at [WordCamp SF 2010][2]. I&#8217;ll be speaking in Hebrew this time, but the slides will be in English and I&#8217;ll share them here afterwards.

There are 3 tracks planned &#8211; beginner developers, advanced developers and publishers &#8211; see Jennifer&#8217;s post for an [overview of the planned Publisher&#8217;s track][3] and visit [WordCamp Jerusalem][1] for more information.
